# Lightspeed Chat

#### Description:
Lightspeed Chat seems like any other standard chat application. However, it has 1 major secret feature. Privacy has been emphasized more and more in the coming years. With Lightspeed Chat you can host your own chat server through your own Firebase account. Switching servers is as easy as replacing the google-services.json file. This allows you to have more control on who can see the messages. 

Lightspeed Chat currently only supports Android and is written in Java with its UI made using XML (not Android Jetpack). Its backend is entirely on Firebase to give you full control. Lightspeed Chat uses realtime database to store messages and their metadata. You can create chats with any of the users on your Lightspeed Chat server. The app also has features that allow you to change your profile picture and password.

If I were to make Lightspeed Chat again, I would have implemented my own backend to emphasize on privacy; however, I would remain to support Firebase due to its ease of use. The method to change servers will avoid having to recompile the app due to the inconvenience. I would also have written the app in Kotlin. One of the features that I tried to implement that I failed at implementing in time was notifications. However, I plan to add this feature soon. I also plan to implement group chats in Lightspeed Chat; to allow users to switch all their chats to a more secure and trustable app. Finally, I would like to make an iOS and web app to reach more users.
